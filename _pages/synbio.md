### Lu Lab, MIT Synthetic Biology Center			  	          	    
##### *Undergraduate Researcher, September 2019 - March 2020*

#### My Project:
Gum disease affects half of adult Americans and can lead to cavities and potential bone loss. Curent treatments include gum graft surgery which are only sometimes successful. Using a synthetic biology approach, I tested an *in vitro* approach to create gum grafts for long-term maintenance.

#### My Role:
Specifically, I expanded on previous work done by an undergraduate who built constitutively active plasmids showing fluorescence and expression of growth factors when successfully transduced into the target cells. I added NFkB sensitive regions to the plasmids that would express the downstream protein of interest only when activated by the B or T cells. Then, I combined parts of previous plasmids to produce combinations of growth factors to enhance regeneration.

#### Skills Developed:â€‹
- Design of synthetic biology gene circuits
- Mammalian cell culture, molecular cloning, and lentivirus production
- Analysis of biological data including fluorescence, flow cytometry, and PCR
- Experimental problem solving
- Integrating work into a larger project
