## Alnylam Pharmaceuticals   				     				     
##### *RNAi Discovery Co-op, January 2021 - Current*  
&nbsp;  
#### RNA Interference:
RNA Interference (RNAi) is effective way to reduce levels of specific mRNA through targeted degradation. Double stranded siRNA is loaded into the RISC complex and the antisense strand is used as a complementary guide to cleave target mRNA. Using this natural pathway and innovations in chemical modifications and drug delivery such as GalNAc-siRNA conjugates and LNPs (lipid nanoparticles), Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has brought several drugs to the market.

#### My Role:
As part of the annealing and testing group in the RNAi Discovery department, I prepared and analyzed siRNA duplexes. By assessing the purity and identity of oligonucleotide single strands and duplexes through mass spectrometry, I contributed to hundreds of in vitro and in vivo preclinical drug development studies. I also founded and led a co-op journal club and presented on recent literature relating to RNAi.

#### Skills Developed:â€‹
- Mass spectrometry, osmolality, endotoxin, pH, and OD analysis
- Detail-oriented work
- Collaboration within group and across departments
- Scientific communication in co-op journal club (founded and led)
