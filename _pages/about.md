I am a current undergraduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) studying biological engineering. Over the past few years, I have worked in designing synthetic biology gene circuits and developing an RNA sequencing analysis pipeline. Currently I am at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals working on RNA interference oligonucleotide research.

By using novel ideas in biology, chemistry, and engineering, I hope to solve medical problems in drug delivery, human diseases, and nucleotide engineering.

I also love backpacking, cycling, and traveling!
