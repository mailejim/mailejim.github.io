I am an undergraduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) studying biological engineering. Over the past few years, I have worked in synthetic biology and RNA sequencing analysis. Currently I am at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals working on RNA interference oligonucleotide research.

I am passionate about solving medical problems with novel ideas in biology, chemistry, and engineering. I am interested inÂ drug delivery, human diseases, and nucleotide engineering.

I also love backpacking, cycling, and traveling!


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
